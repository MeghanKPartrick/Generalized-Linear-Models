<h1>Generalized Linear Models</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is based off of the textbook "Extending the Linear Model with R" by Julian J. Faraway. These are exercises completed based off of Chapter 8: Generalized Linear Models, where in depth generalized linear models are created and analyzed. This also includes manual compution of glm coefficients to show how convergence occurs to copy generalized linear models.
